                    <h3>Service to youth and community has been the foremost principle of the Optimist Clubs for more than 90 years. The Optimist Motto, "Friend of Youth", is exemplified by some of the many projects our club sponsors anually.</h3>

                            <p>An emphasis is made on academic achievement. Not only do we sponsor events like essay-writing and speech, but also we offer several sizeable college scholarships each June to deserving students. Every year the club holds a "Student Recognition Day" event to honor those many outsanding kids in the elementary schools in Polk County.</p>

                            <p>Physical activity is necessary for all people to help ensure a lifetime of good health. Offering kids the opportunity to be active and to compete is crucial for their personal development. Forming healthy physical habits should start early. The club sponsors various physical activities as well as specific athletic events.</p>

                            <p>Fund raising is truly the bottom-line: The more we raise, the more we can offer to our kids and organizations that we support. Our major fund raiser, the Christmas Tree Lot, is held yearly just after Thanksgiving till mid December. We also hold events at Carols in the Park, Belk's Clothing store, and have sold Smencils and Coupon Books.</p>
