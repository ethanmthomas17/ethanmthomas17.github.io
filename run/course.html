            <h5>Winter Haven, Florida</h5>
            <p class="margin-bottom-small"> Winter Haven is a beautiful city of approximately 35,000 friendly folks. As the Chamber of Commerce mentions, "To some we're the perfect haven from the harsh winter months up North, and to others we are the opportunity to be involved in a town with over 55 lakes to enjoy with
                fantastic sunrises and sunsets over the water" ...AND an absolutely supurb terrain for running.  </p>

            <p class="margin-bottom-small">This particular course includes gentle rises, enough to cause pressure for the advanced competitors but not so much to frustrate the average person.  This trek will pass by three pristine lakes and many lovely holiday decorated homes. It will be  well marked with security and volunteers all along  the route. </p>

            <p class="margin-bottom">Newbies are especially encouraged to join the fastest growing athletic activity in the world.  Running encourages increased physical fitness, effective weight control, greater patience, and an overall sense of well-being.  Besides that, runners seem to be among the most happy, up-beat, smiling, smart, fun-loving, good-looking, physically-fit humans on the planet. At the Finish, everyone is exhausted, sweaty, smelly, somewhat dirty, frequently nauseous, but...  SMILING!</p>
